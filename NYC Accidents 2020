--Data for NYC accidents in 202 was downloaded from the Maven Data Playground.
--NYC accident data was then converted from .csv to .xlsx and parsed into a database table.
--Analytics were made using SQL queries on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

--Percentage of total accidents by month.
SELECT MONTH(crash_date) AS id, DATENAME(month, crash_date) AS month, COUNT(*) AS num_of_crashes, COUNT(*)*100.0/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS crash_percent 
	FROM NYCA_DB..NYCAccidents2020
	GROUP BY MONTH(crash_date), DATENAME(month, crash_date)
	ORDER BY MONTH(crash_date);

--Break down of accident frequency by day of week.
SELECT DATEPART(weekday, crash_date) AS id, DATENAME(weekday, crash_date) AS day, COUNT(crash_date) AS total_crashes
	FROM NYCA_DB..NYCAccidents2020
	GROUP BY DATEPART(weekday, crash_date), DATENAME(weekday, crash_date)
	ORDER BY DATEPART(weekday, crash_date);

--Street with the most to least reported accidents and percentage of all reported accidents.
SELECT CONCAT(on_street_name, off_street_name) AS location, COUNT(*) AS  total_crashes, COUNT(*)*100.0/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS crash_percent, latitude, longitude, location
	FROM NYCA_DB..NYCAccidents2020
	GROUP BY CONCAT(on_street_name, off_street_name), latitude, longitude, location
	ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

--Most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample based on Vehicle 1. Total fatal accidents per category.
SELECT contributing_factor_vehicle_1, SUM(persons_killed) AS sum_fatalities, COUNT(*) AS total_contributing_factor
	FROM NYCA_DB..NYCAccidents2020
